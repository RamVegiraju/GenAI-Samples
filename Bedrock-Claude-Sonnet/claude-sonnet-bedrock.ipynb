The dog's face fills most of the frame, with its fluffy, tightly curled fur and black nose clearly visible. The laptop's keyboard and screen edge can be seen in the foreground, indicating the dog is likely watching or interacting with content on the computer. The background is slightly blurred, appearing to be an indoor setting like an office or living room.
